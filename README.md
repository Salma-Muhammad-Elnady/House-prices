# **House Prices Regression Project**
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing different features of houses, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on historical data.
 # **Project Aims** 
 ### 1. Data import:
* Download the house price dataset from Kaggle.
* Import and clean data by handling any missing or incorrect values ​​and dealing with outliers.

 ### 2. Data Analysis:
* Explore data and analyze different features.
* Create visualizations to highlight the relationships between different features and house prices.

### 3. Model Building: 
* Try different algorithms like: LinearRegression, polynomial regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random forest, Decision tree.
* Train the model using the data and evaluate its performance using metrics like: R2-Score, MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE.

### 4. Model Improvement:
* Improve the model using techniques like cross-validation and feature engineering.
* Compare different models and select the one that provides the best accuracy.
